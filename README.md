                                                                  so this is my last project for foundation courst
                                                                   but realise that i still have a long way to go
                                If anyone happens to go through my code and wants to offer suggestions or teach me more, I would be more than happy to receive them.
                        Thank you for the time to come in, and thanks to the Odin Project for providing such great learning resources. Hope you all keep up the good work!
